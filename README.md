### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have 15 years of experience in product, software engineering and technical leadership at startups and companies like Google and Facebook.  I've gone back and forth between Product Management and Engineering throughout my career as I love thinking about the big picture and designing great experiences, and also really enjoy coding.  I am just finishing up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in early 2023 and would like to continue writing code on a daily basis in whatever comes next.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [visualizing](https://github.com/hbridge/iOSEnergyViz) [energy & climate data](https://github.com/hbridge/egrid-server) and building out my [personal CRM system on top of Notion](https://github.com/hbridge/gcontact-notion-sync)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to configure and deploy backends, Next.js, and Go
